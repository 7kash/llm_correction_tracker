# Project Plan - LLM Learning Visualizer

## Project Vision

Create the most accessible, visually compelling educational tool for understanding how Large Language Models process feedback and adapt their responses. Transform complex AI concepts into intuitive visualizations that anyone can understand.

## Mission Statement

**Democratize AI understanding** by making semantic similarity, embeddings, and LLM behavior tangible through beautiful, interactive visualizations and plain-English explanations.

- Vector movement in 2D semantic space (UMAP/PCA)
- Sentence-level comparison heatmaps
- Plain-English change descriptions
- Multiple similarity metrics (cosine, Jaccard, angle)

**Timeline**: Latest major update (October 2025)

**Impact**:
- Transformed from "word counter" to "meaning analyzer"
- Users can SEE semantic changes visually
- Educational value increased 10x

---

### ✅ Phase 4: Interactive Education (Completed)
**Goal**: Teach attention and temperature through interaction

**Delivered**:
- Voting Council demo (attention mechanism)
- Probability Funnel demo (temperature & softmax)
- Theory boxes (cyan) for concepts
- Explanation boxes (purple) for visualizations
- Calculation boxes (orange) for formulas
- Collapsible sections for better UX

**Timeline**: October 2025
